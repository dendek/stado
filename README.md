**What is stado?**

Stado is minimalistic static site generator powered by python scripts.
You just download stado.py and it is ready to work.


**What? Why another static site generator?**

Stado is different:

- No dependencies, batteries are included: markdown support, mustache templates,
yaml.
- Only one file (actually less than **100kb**).
- Pages creation powered by python scripts.
- Site content from **yaml** or **json** files.
- Development server.
- File watcher for site auto-rebuilding.
- Manage group of sites (can build or watch more than one site).
- Easy and minimalistic.

Stado is best for small, files driven sites. You can use python scripts so the sky
is the limit, probably.


**What do I need?**

Only python3, currently supported versions: 3.2, 3.3


**Is it ready?**

No, but it is close to first production release. Just stay tuned.

To be done:
```

- Command for creating new site project.
- Plugins:

    layout,
    helper,
    pages,
    assets,

- Quick-guide
- Documentation

```



**Where are docs?**

Actually nowhere ;)


**Tests?**
